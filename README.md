# Fine tune a pre-trained model for sentiment analysis

The Hugging Face Hub has the largest collection of models and datasets for various NLP task. 

Using IMDB dataset to fine-tune a DistilBERT model for sentiment analysis. The IMDB dataset contains 25,000 movie reviews labeled by sentiment for training a model and 25,000 movie reviews for testing it. DistilBERT is a smaller, faster and cheaper version of BERT. It has 40% smaller than BERT and runs 60% faster while preserving over 95% of BERTâ€™s performance. 

Once DistillBERT is trained, it can be used to analyze new data
